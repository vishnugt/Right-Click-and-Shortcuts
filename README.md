# Right-Click-and-Shortcuts
  I have a little problem with my touchpad, so if I want to right click, I have to bruteforce all the positions in the right-bottom part of my touchpad, and the success rate will be close to hardly 20%.
  
  So in order to overcome this, I wrote this python script, which will bind [Windows + F3] to right click (We can also add other shortcuts too).
  
  With [Shift + F10], I wasn't able to perform a right click on the taskbar and in some other places.
  

#Build Instructions
  You might want to install pywin32 (pip install pywin32).  Other than that, mostly all packages comes pre installed.
  
  You are ready to run the program. 

#Cheers
